# "Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset"
The "Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset" project is a machine learning and computer vision endeavor that focuses on classifying a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images into ten distinct classes. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of image recognition and machine learning, containing 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into two main subsets: 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing
# Project Objective :
Image Classification: The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust image classification model capable of correctly categorizing images into one of the ten predefined classes. These classes can represent various objects, animals, or scenes, making the project a valuable exercise in pattern recognition.
Machine Learning Experimentation: The project serves as a practical exercise for exploring and experimenting with various machine learning algorithms and other classification models.
Model Evaluation: Extensive model evaluation will be performed to assess the accuracy and performance of the trained models on the test dataset. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be considered to measure the model's effectiveness.
